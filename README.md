# Microbiodata_16s_Replication
This project investigates the microbial communities associated with stingless bees using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We use the DADA2 pipeline in R to process raw FASTQ files into Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs), followed by taxonomic assignment using the Silva v138 database.
